<h1 align="center">styled-react-tsx</h1>

This is a very small boilerplate to using React styled components with Typescript and Babel.

### What includes?

The dependencies are really minimal. Here are some of them:

- babel (with some presets & plugins)
- typescript
- tslint
- react
- styled-jsx (with PostCSS plugin)
- postcss
- gulp (for styles build)
- webpack (for js build)
- webpack-dev-server

### Which scripts do I have available?

You have three four scripts:

- `start`: run the application using webpack-dev-server.
- `build:css`: execute gulp tasks to compile and minify styles.
- `build:js`: execute webpack to compile typescript and react code.
- `build`: execute two scripts above.

**Note:** builds will generate sourcemaps.

### How to extend

You just could install your favourites packages and edit the configuration files if are necessary. For example, you could add sass and edit the webpack file to add a rule for it.
